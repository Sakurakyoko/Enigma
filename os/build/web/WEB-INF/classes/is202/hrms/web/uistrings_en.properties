index_h1=Welcome to HRMS 2.0
index_p1=This is the second version of a simple human resource management system. It demonstrates most features from chapter 4 in the lecture notes. It does not use a database. Data are kept in memory in lists in the backing beans. (or hashtables or sets in some cases).
index_p2=Some of the demonstrated features are quite advanced, and may appear daunting at first. Study the example, and the lecture notes, one featue at a time (by using it in the pages you write).
